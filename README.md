# Pattrn Party

## Description
This was a recreation of a static comp provided below. The goal was to create a small responsive styleguide. This was my first project implementing a CSS preprocessor (SCSS) as well as implmenting BEM (Block Element Modifier) in my code. I found that BEM definitely simplifies some of the large complex logic that CSS code causes and allows for more readable code.
